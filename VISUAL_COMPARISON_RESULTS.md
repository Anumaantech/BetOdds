# 🎯 Visual-Aware AI Results: PERFECT ALIGNMENT!

## 📊 **Before vs After Comparison**

### ❌ **OLD SYSTEM (betting_events.json)**
```json
{
  "event": "Will Punjab Kings win the match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru?",
  "options": {"Yes": 5, "No": 5}
}
```
**Problems:**
- ❌ Wrong team names (Punjab Kings vs RCB instead of Gujarat Titans vs Mumbai Indians)
- ❌ Generic events with no player focus
- ❌ Wrong thresholds (55.5, 57.5 vs actual 26.5, 28.5, 31.5)
- ❌ Redundant over/under pairs
- ❌ No visual hierarchy understanding

### ✅ **NEW VISUAL-AWARE SYSTEM (visual_enhanced_events.json)**
```json
{
  "event": "Will Abhimanyu Easwaran score over 31.5 runs in the first innings?",
  "description": "Individual player performance - Abhimanyu Easwaran scoring prediction",
  "category": "player_performance",
  "priority": "high",
  "visual_prominence": "high",
  "confidence": "high"
}
